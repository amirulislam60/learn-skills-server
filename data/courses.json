From a career point of view, having HTML as part of your language pack (meaning the number of languages that you know) is very helpful, especially if you work a lot with web applications or intend to be a full-stack developer.",

        "detail": "Sometimes it becomes necessary to convert an object into a string in order to view or store it. For the purpose of debugging, a simple console.log() will suffice, as just about any modern browser’s Dev Tools will provide a pretty printed version of an object. Meanwhile, relying on implicit conversion when writing an object to any other location will only result in the utterly useless “[object Object]” string. Far better results can be achieved using JavaScript’s built-in JSON.stringify() method or by writing your own conversion function. Each of these will produce differing results, so it pays to carefully consider each option before deciding which approach best suits your requirements. With that in mind, we are going to try our hand at a few strategies here, including using the toSting() method, custom conversion methods, as well as the aforementioned JSON.stringify() in today’s web development tutorial.",
